### Section 3: Working Remotely with Github Repos

## Challenge 3.1

  	Suppose you won't have a wifi connection later on and you need to work on the
  	project in that time period.
  	How can you download the repo from Github to your local machine?

## Challenge 3.2

  	Now you need to upload these files back to your git repository.
  	How'll you upload these files?

## Challenge 3.3

  	Imagine you're more efficient when working on your local machine instead of
